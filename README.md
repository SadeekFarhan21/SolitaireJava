# Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

# Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


# How the code works
## SolitaireSwing
SolitaireSwing is a Java Swing application that allows users to play the classic game of Solitaire. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to learn, and it features a variety of customization options that allow users to tailor the game to their own preferences.

## Features
SolitaireSwing includes the following features:

- A variety of game modes, including Klondike, FreeCell, and Spider Solitaire
- A built-in tutorial that teaches users how to play the game
- A variety of customization options, such as the ability to change the card backs and the background
- A scoring system that keeps track of the user's progress

## How to Play
To play SolitaireSwing, simply click on the "New Game" button to start a new game. The game will then deal the cards face down into a 7x4 grid. The goal of the game is to move all of the cards to the foundation piles, which are located at the top of the screen. Cards can only be moved to a foundation pile if they are of the same suit and in descending order. For example, a 7 of hearts can be moved to a foundation pile that already contains a 6 of hearts, a 5 of hearts, and a 4 of hearts.

Cards can also be moved to the tableau piles, which are located below the foundation piles. Cards can be moved to a tableau pile if they are one rank higher or lower than the top card in the pile. For example, a 6 of hearts can be moved to a tableau pile that contains a 7 of hearts, or a 5 of hearts can be moved to a tableau pile that contains a 6 of hearts.

The waste pile is located at the bottom of the screen. Cards can be moved from the waste pile to any tableau pile or foundation pile if they are of the correct suit and in descending order.

If the user gets stuck, they can use the hint button to get a suggestion for a possible move. The user can also undo their last move by clicking on the undo button.

## Customization
SolitaireSwing allows users to customize the game to their own preferences. Users can change the card backs, the background, and the difficulty level. Users can also choose to play with sound effects or music.

## Scoring
SolitaireSwing keeps track of the user's progress by awarding points for each card that is moved to a foundation pile. The user's score is displayed at the top of the screen. The user with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

## Conclusion
SolitaireSwing is a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is easy to learn and play, and it features a variety of customization options that allow users to tailor the game to their own preferences. SolitaireSwing is a great way to relax and unwind, and it can also help to improve the user's memory and concentration.
